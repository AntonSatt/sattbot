Ideas:
RSS to discord 
Maybe pull down data and make a weekly summary of the content? (Daily summary would be to much?)
Weekly poll suggest from the weekly news? 
(https://metacurate.io/
https://metacurate.io/briefs/daily/latest/rss

New Feature:
Make a new feature for the bot to be able to post a weekly summary of the daily feed from metacurate.io rss feed. 
Use openrouter ai-model to create the summary of the total weekly feed that we store each day.
